<h1><b>Face Detection Using OpenCV</b></h1>
This repository contains Python code for detecting faces in images and live video streams using OpenCV.

<h2>Overview</h2>
Face detection is a computer vision technique that identifies human faces in digital images or video frames. This project utilizes the OpenCV library, a popular open-source computer vision and machine learning software library, to perform real-time face detection.

<h3>Features</h3>
--Detection of faces in images and live video streams
--Drawing bounding boxes around detected faces
--Works with both images and webcam feeds

<h4>Installation</h4>
<p>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-detection-opencv.git </p>

<p> pip install opencv-python </p>

<p>python3 face.py</p>

 <br>A window will open showing the live webcam feed with detected faces.
